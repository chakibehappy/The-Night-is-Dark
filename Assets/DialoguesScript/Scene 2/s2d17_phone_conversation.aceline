The dispatcher: Hello Aiden, any news about the murder?
Aiden Hayes: Hey, yes. I found the murder weapon, it’s a knife, but no fingerprints. I collected blood samples for the lab, so I’ll pass them on when I’m back. Looks like the victim had an affair with a man called Leonard. Can you check that for me? 
The dispatcher: Sure, we already interrogate the husband, Tyler Matthews. Of course, he says he didn’t do it. 
Aiden Hayes: What’s his alibi?
The dispatcher: He was at his mother’s house.
Aiden Hayes: I see. Check if it’s true.
The dispatcher: Already on it. Did you find anything more about the victim?
Aiden Hayes: Ah yea, she was working for a company named “EcoTech Engineering Solutions”. Can you check the address and send it to me?
The dispatcher: Alright, no problem. Is that all Aiden?
Aiden Hayes: Yeah, call me when you find the lover.
The dispatcher: Sure, talk to you later.
