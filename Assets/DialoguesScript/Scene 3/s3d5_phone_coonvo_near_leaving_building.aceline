The dispatcher: Hey Aiden, it’s me again. We found the lover. His name is Leonard Murphy.
Aiden Hayes: Alright, his alibi?
The dispatcher: He’s clear, he’s been out of town since Monday.
Aiden Hayes: Hmm, okay. Any news about the husband?
The dispatcher: Not yet, we’re checking surveillance cameras to confirm his alibi. Will update you later. Oh, but I found that EcoTech-something company. I’ll send you a message with the address.
Aiden Hayes: Alright, I’ll go there now.
The dispatcher: I’ll call when I have more information.
