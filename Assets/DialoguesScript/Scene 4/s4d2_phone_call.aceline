The dispatcher: 
Hey, just wanted to tell you that the husband is clear. He moved out a few days ago after discovering she was cheating. 
Since then he’s been at his mother’s place. He has an alibi at the time of the murder, he was with friends at the bar.
Aiden Hayes: Hey, thanks a lot. 
The dispatcher: Oh also! The autopsy showed that the victim died because of one wound. 
The rest was done after she died. It wasn’t hateful stabbing, it looked more like a cover-up.
Aiden Hayes: That’s interesting, thank you. Talk to you later.
